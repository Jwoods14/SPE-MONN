# SPE-MONN
### Requirements:
Python2.7  
rdkit (for preprocessing)  
Pytorch >= 0.4.0  
scikit-learn  
### Usage:  
The benchmark dataset can be found in ./data, and the data processing can follow protocol in  **[MONN: a Multi-Objective Neural Network for Predicting Pairwise Non-Covalent Interactions and Binding Affinities between Compounds and Proteins](https://github.com/lishuya17/MONN)**.  
The PtsRep protein embeddings can be found in our another article **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning of Protein Tertiary Structures (PtsRep) and Its Implications for Protein Engineering](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.423916v2.abstract)**, and TAPE or UniRep can be found in **[repo](https://github.com/songlab-cal/tape)**.
